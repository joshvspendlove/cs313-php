			<p class="card-text">Ever since I started working for Control4 back in 2018, automation has been on forefront of my mind. From automating my home to automating the various tasks I'm asked to perform at work, I've spent tireless hours trying to simplify my life in any way I can. However, in my attempts to simplify, I feel I ultimately complicate. Not complicate in that tasks get harder to perform, complicate such that I am never satisfied with the end result. Automation, to me, is an ever expanding abyss, the gap of which I will never be able to bridge.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Since the first programming class I took in highschool, I've had a desire to learn as much as I could about the power behind programming. Starting off with Java, I've stretched my limits by learning C++, Lua, Python, and SQL as well as HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I am eager to continue my journey of becoming a software developer and see what I can create.</p>
